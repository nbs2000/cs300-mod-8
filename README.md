cs 300 module 8 journal
I wish I had edited the code that exists now to better fit the conditions of the project but due to time, 
it was harder to squeeze in time to write, edit, and make sure the code fit the criteria for the project
2 directions.

 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
 In module 6, we were calculating run time analysis on the different data structures that we read in zybooks throughout the course. In module 7, you were to apply a binary tree to a programming application and then analyze its runtime and memory and then have it output to a alphabetically sorted list.
 How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
 With each data structure, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages. However, they are important to understand because they help organize data accordingly. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In my personal opinion, the best way to overcome any road blocks encountered is through careful planning. On some assignments, I created flowcharts to get a better idea on how the application should act from start to finish. Psuedocode is also an excellent help and acts as a blueprint to help you create your code.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Mostly, it has made me more confident in my approach to brainstorming and creating applications. Beforehand, I was always nervous and intimidated by analyzing data but now, approaching it through planning and trying to find a foundation for the software has really helped me mentally and has boosted my confidence in coding. There are times where I slip up and misunderstand the directions, but with practice and planning, its helped me a lot throughout my coding journey.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By giving me some expeirence in analyzing data and how to organize it, I've started to understand and get comfortable with how data is handled in the coding industry. I believe that having more experience under your belt will make you more of a well rounded software developer if you take the time to learn, review, and practice as much as you can.
